    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the formation of solid particles in the gallbladder. While traditional risk factors are well documented—often summarized by the \"4 Fs\" (Female, Forty, Fat, Fertile)—the specific interplay between modern metabolic markers (such as visceral fat, hepatic steatosis, and lipid profiles) and gallstone risk requires rigorous statistical investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "**To what extent can metabolic and demographic factors predict the presence of gallstone disease, and does a reduced model relying on key risk factors perform as well as the full model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to **infer** the relationship between these risk factors and the probability of gallstones. We assume that a \"Full Model\" containing all available clinical predictors may suffer from multicollinearity (especially among lipid markers) and unnecessary complexity. Therefore, we will employ a **Forward Selection** algorithm to derive a parsimonious model and compare its performance against the Full Model to determine the optimal set of predictors for clinical assessment."

    "## 3. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthesis:**\n",
    "This study aimed to determine if a parsimonious set of risk factors could predict gallstone disease as effectively as a comprehensive model. Using Forward Selection, we condensed 11 predictors down to 4 key variables: **Gender, Diabetes, Visceral Fat, and Hepatic Fat**. The reduced model achieved a lower AIC than the full model, answering our research question affirmatively: a reduced model performs *better* by reducing noise and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings & Implications:**\n",
    "1.  **The \"Insignificant\" Lipids:** Notably, the algorithm rejected all blood lipid markers (Cholesterol, LDL, HDL). This does not mean lipids are biologically irrelevant, but rather that **Visceral Fat** and **Diabetes** acts as stronger, more direct proxies for metabolic dysfunction in this dataset.\n",
    "2.  **Key Risk Factors:**\n",
    "    * **Diabetes (OR ~2.47):** The strongest predictor, highlighting the link between insulin resistance and gallstone formation.\n",
    "    * **Visceral Fat:** Proved to be a more valuable predictor than BMI, suggesting that *fat distribution* matters more than total mass.\n",
    "    * **Gender:** Males showed higher risk in this specific clinical sample, a finding that requires context as it deviates from general population trends (typically female-dominant).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "The primary limitation is the observational nature of the data; we can infer association, not causation. Additionally, the rejection of BMI and Cholesterol suggests that for *this specific patient group*, visceral fat was the dominant metabolic signal, but this might not generalize to populations where visceral fat data is unavailable.\n",
